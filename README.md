# Prime Tester App

You will build an app that tests whether a number is prime.


*A prime number is a number only divisible by 1 and itself.*

In order to complete this app, you will need to demonstrate an understanding of methods, control flow — conditionals and loops — as 
well as variables, operators, and basic UIBuilder.
